# SET-Assignment-Test-method
For the purpose of Software Engineering Testing Assignment, these are the test methods for the assignment.

This code is only for the SET assignment as this tests the method I choose.

It only tests BubbleSort() and SelectionSort()

testSorts.py complements the file https://github.com/Kyn21kx/SimpleSortingBenchmarks/blob/main/algorithms.py
